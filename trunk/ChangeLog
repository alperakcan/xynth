	various programs that are directly ported. Ahh, i must prepare a color

	* (S&C) socket.c : can you believe that read&write is faster than
	send&recieve?

	* server : some improvements for fast window drawing, needs more work.

Thu Jul 17 00:42:52 2003
	* server : no more remaining shared memory segments from now on.

Wed Jul 16 18:21:46 2003
	* server & lib : name changed from sde to S.
	* server window.c : some corrections.

Wed Jul 16 17:42:03 2003
	* server : some changes in theme.c

Mon Jul 14 22:10:17 2003
	* server & client : int *matrix etc. changed to char * to decrease
	working memory space (4 byte > 1 byte). But max amount of clients is
	now limeted to 127. Anyway who wants more than 256 ? This can be
	changed to 255 easily with little work if needed.

	* : only the surface matrix is shared for now.
	* server : matrix[][] is changed with linear marix. I think non-linear
	one was working faster, easier than the linear one but...

	* : This was the second try of server client system on svgalib.
	And the first one was using shared memory and semaphores, but
	that was not really a server client system, the fore client was acting
	as  server. ;) But had really embedded behaves.
	    This one was built on socket data transfer, using UDS. But I see
	that this is really much slower than working with shared memory. So,
	here is the idea, from now on, sserver is using both sockets and
	shared memory to be much more faster.
	    Although I am using shared memory there is no need to use
	semaphores for now. Becouse server calls clients after changing the
	matrix.

	* client : done with right-left resize.
	* server : ~= done ;)

Wed Jul  9 18:56:03 2003
	* server&client : will do window resize.

Sun Jul  6 21:15:55 2003
	* : I didnot log any of changes so far, becouse I did not think that
	this project wil really work ;) I tried a lot of different ways to get
	the right way. Now here I am ;) The very important change is the
	name ;) "SServer".
	* svgaserver : works fine.
	* svgaclient : works fine.
