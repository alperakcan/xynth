microgui
--------

A port of the sawfish theme.

Here follows the original sawfish theme comments :

This theme is based on the QNX Photon microGUI (screenshots at
http://www.qnx.com/amiga/delivering.html).  Many image components were
taken from the minEguE enlightenment theme by Ben FrantzDale
(frantb@rpi.edu). The rest is by Ryan Lovett (ryan@ocf.berkeley.edu)
with modifications from John Harper.
